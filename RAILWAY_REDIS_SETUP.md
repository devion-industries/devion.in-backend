# 🚀 Railway Redis Setup Guide

## 📋 Quick Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Your Railway Dashboard
1. Open: https://railway.app/
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Find your **devion-backend** project
4. Click to open it

---

### Step 2: Add Redis Plugin
1. In your project dashboard, click **"+ New"** button (top right)
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"Add Redis"**
4. Railway will create a Redis instance automatically

**What happens:**
- ✅ Redis instance created
- ✅ `REDIS_URL` environment variable auto-injected
- ✅ Internal networking configured
- ✅ Ready to use!

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Go to your backend service in Railway
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Your latest deployment should be building (triggered by git push)
4. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

**Check Logs:**
1. Click on the latest deployment
2. Click **"View Logs"**
3. Look for these success messages:
   ```
   ✅ Redis: Connected and ready
   🚀 Devion Backend Server started on port 3001
   ```

---

### Step 4: Test Redis Caching

#### Test 1: First Question (Cache MISS)
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.devion.in/api/ai/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"question": "what are bonds?"}'
```

**Check Logs:** Should see:
```
AI cache MISS for question: "what are bonds?..."
AI Tutor response generated - Tokens: 350
AI response CACHED for question: "what are bonds?..."
```

#### Test 2: Same Question Again (Cache HIT)
```bash
# Ask the same question again
curl -X POST https://api.devion.in/api/ai/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"question": "what are bonds?"}'
```

**Check Logs:** Should see:
```
AI cache HIT for question: "what are bonds?..."
```

**Result:** Instant response, 0 tokens used! 💰

---

### Step 5: Test Rate Limiting

#### Test: Exceed Rate Limit
```bash
# Make 11 requests rapidly (limit is 10/hour)
for i in {1..11}; do
  curl -X POST https://api.devion.in/api/ai/ask \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
    -d "{\"question\": \"test question $i\"}"
  echo "\n"
done
```

**Expected Response (on 11th request):**
```json
{
  "error": "You have reached your AI question limit. Please try again in 60 minutes.",
  "statusCode": 429
}
```

**Check Response Headers:**
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1734534000
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Redis

### View Redis Metrics in Railway:
1. Click on Redis database in your project
2. View metrics:
   - Memory usage
   - Operations per second
   - Connected clients
   - Hit/Miss ratio

### View Redis Logs:
1. Click Redis database
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. See connection logs and errors

---

## 🎯 What You Get

### 1. Cost Savings
- **Before:** 100 users ask "what are bonds?" = 100 API calls = $0.50
- **After:** 100 users ask "what are bonds?" = 1 API call + 99 cache hits = $0.005
- **Savings:** 99% reduction in costs for repeated questions!

### 2. Performance
- **OpenAI API:** 2-5 seconds response time
- **Redis Cache:** <50ms response time
- **100x faster!**

### 3. Protection
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Cost control per user
- Fair usage for all users

---

## 🛠️ Optional: Redis CLI Access

### Connect to Redis via Railway:
1. Click Redis database
2. Click "Data" tab
3. Use built-in Redis CLI

### Common Commands:
```bash
# Check cache for a specific question
GET "ai:cache:abc123..."

# Check rate limit for a user
GET "ratelimit:ai:user-123"

# View all cache keys
KEYS "ai:cache:*"

# Clear all cache
FLUSHDB

# Check memory usage
INFO memory
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Redis connection failed"
**Solution:**
1. Verify Redis plugin is running in Railway
2. Check `REDIS_URL` is set in environment variables
3. Restart backend service

### Issue: Cache not working
**Symptoms:** Every question shows "cache MISS"
**Solution:**
1. Check Redis is connected in logs
2. Try clearing Redis cache: `FLUSHDB`
3. Verify questions are identical (case-insensitive)

### Issue: Rate limiting not working
**Symptoms:** Can make unlimited requests
**Solution:**
1. Check Redis is connected
2. Verify middleware is applied to routes
3. Check logs for rate limit errors
