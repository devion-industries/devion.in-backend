## üöÄ Frontend Integration

### React Query Hook (Example):

```typescript

import { useMutation, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api/client';

export const useVoice = () => {
  const askWithVoice = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async ({ question, voiceType }: { question: string; voiceType?: string }) => {
      const response = await apiClient.post('/voice/ask', { question, voiceType });
      return response.data;
    },
  });

  const playAudio = (base64Audio: string) => {
    const audio = new Audio(`data:audio/mpeg;base64,${base64Audio}`);
    audio.play();
  };

  return { askWithVoice, playAudio };
};
```

### Example Usage in Component:

```typescript
const { askWithVoice, playAudio } = useVoice();

const handleAsk = async () => {
  const result = await askWithVoice.mutateAsync({
    question: "What stocks should I research next?",
    voiceType: "teacher"
  });
  
  // Play the audio response
  playAudio(result.audio);
  
  // Also show text
  console.log(result.answer);
};
```
