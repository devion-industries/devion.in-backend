## üìä What's Been Built

### 1. **AI Service** (`src/services/ai.service.ts`)

A comprehensive AI service powered by OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with:

**Core Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Context-Aware Question Answering** - AI tutor knows about user's portfolio
- ‚úÖ **Portfolio Insights Generation** - Automated analysis of holdings
- ‚úÖ **Concept Explanations** - Simplified explanations for financial terms
- ‚úÖ **Personalized Learning Paths** - AI-suggested next topics based on progress
- ‚úÖ **Health Monitoring** - Service health checks

**AI Persona:**

- Uses Indian context (NSE, BSE, NIFTY 50, ‚Çπ currency)
- Targets teenagers (13-18 years)
- Keeps responses concise (2-3 paragraphs)
- Never gives direct investment advice
- Emphasizes education and learning

---

### 2. **AI Controller** (`src/controllers/ai.controller.ts`)

Complete request handling with 5 endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/ai/ask` | POST | Ask AI tutor any question |
| `/api/ai/portfolio-insights` | GET | Get automated portfolio analysis |
| `/api/ai/explain` | POST | Explain financial concepts |
| `/api/ai/learning-path` | GET | Get personalized learning suggestions |
| `/api/ai/health` | GET | Check AI service status |

---

### 3. **AI Routes** (`src/routes/ai.routes.ts`)

All routes are:
- ‚úÖ Protected with JWT authentication
- ‚úÖ Integrated with main Express app
- ‚úÖ Properly documented with JSDoc comments

## üéØ API Endpoints

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ask AI Tutor

```bash
POST /api/ai/ask
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "What is diversification and why is it important?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "question": "What is diversification and why is it important?",
  "answer": "Think of diversification like not putting all your eggs in one basket! üß∫\n\nImagine you have ‚Çπ10,000 to invest. If you put it all in one stock (say, Reliance), and that stock drops 20%, your entire portfolio loses ‚Çπ2,000. But if you split it across 5 different stocks in different sectors (IT, Banking, FMCG, etc.), even if one drops, the others might stay stable or grow, protecting your overall investment.\n\nDiversification is important because it reduces risk. Different sectors perform differently at different times - when IT stocks are down, maybe banking stocks are up. By spreading your investments, you're not depending on just one company's success. It's one of the smartest strategies for long-term investing! üìà",
  "tokensUsed": 145
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get Portfolio Insights

```bash
GET /api/ai/portfolio-insights
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "insights": [
    "Your portfolio shows strong diversification across 3 sectors (IT, Banking, Energy), which helps manage risk effectively.",
    "TCS is your top performer at +4.2%, demonstrating the strength of quality IT stocks in the current market.",
    "Consider adding FMCG or Healthcare stocks to further balance your sector exposure.",
    "Your overall 2.1% gain shows steady growth - maintain this disciplined approach!"
  ],
  "summary": "Your portfolio demonstrates solid fundamentals with balanced sector allocation and consistent performance.",
  "portfolioValue": 105467.85,
  "holdingsCount": 5
}
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain Concept

```bash
POST /api/ai/explain
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "concept": "P/E Ratio"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "concept": "P/E Ratio",
  "explanation": "P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings) is like asking: 'How many years would it take for this company's profits to equal its stock price?'\n\nImagine a stock costs ‚Çπ1,000, and the company earns ‚Çπ100 per share annually. The P/E ratio is 10 (‚Çπ1,000 √∑ ‚Çπ100). This means you're paying 10 years' worth of earnings for one share.\n\nA lower P/E might mean the stock is undervalued (a potential bargain!), while a higher P/E might mean investors expect strong future growth. For context, NIFTY 50 companies typically have P/E ratios between 15-25. It's a useful tool to compare stocks within the same sector! üìä"
}
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Get Learning Path

```bash
GET /api/ai/learning-path
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

**Response:**
```json

  "completedLessons": 3,
  "nextTopics": [
    "Portfolio Diversification",
    "Risk Management",
    "Sector Analysis",
    "Technical Analysis Basics",
    "Reading Financial Statements"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Based on your foundational knowledge, these topics will help you build a more strategic approach to investing. Focus on diversification and risk management first, then explore sector analysis to identify opportunities."
}
```

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "AI Tutor",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T18:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## üé® Key Features

### Context-Aware Responses
The AI knows about the user's:
- Portfolio value
- Current holdings (symbols, quantities, P&L)
- Recent trades
- Learning progress

This allows for **personalized, relevant answers**!

### Example:
**Without context:**
"Diversification means spreading your investments across different stocks."

**With context (user holds only IT stocks):**
"I noticed 80% of your portfolio is in IT stocks (TCS, INFY). While these are great companies, consider adding stocks from other sectors like Banking (HDFCBANK) or FMCG (ITC) to reduce sector-specific risk. This way, if IT faces headwinds, your other holdings can balance it out! üìä"

## üöÄ Usage in Frontend

### React Query Hook (to be created):

```typescript
// src/hooks/useAI.tsx
import { useMutation, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api/client';

export const useAI = () => {
  const askQuestion = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (question: string) => {
      const response = await apiClient.post('/ai/ask', { question });
      return response.data;
    },
  });

  const { data: insights, isLoading: isLoadingInsights } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['portfolioInsights'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await apiClient.get('/ai/portfolio-insights');
      return response.data;
    },
    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // Cache for 5 minutes
  });

  return { askQuestion, insights, isLoadingInsights };
};
```

### Example Usage in Component:

```typescript
const { askQuestion } = useAI();

const handleAsk = async () => {
  const result = await askQuestion.mutateAsync("What stocks should I research next?");
  console.log(result.answer); // AI response
};
```
